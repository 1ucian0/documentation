# Build your first circuit


The basic element needed for your first program in Qiskit is a `QuantumCircuit`. We begin by creating a `QuantumCircuit` comprised of three qubits.

```python
# Create a Quantum Circuit acting on a quantum register of three qubits
circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
```

After you create the circuit with its registers, you can add _gates_ (“operations”) to manipulate the registers. Following is an example of a quantum circuit that makes a three-qubit GHZ state:

$$|\psi\rangle = \left(|000\rangle+|111\rangle\right)/\sqrt{2}.$$

To create such a state, we start with a three-qubit quantum register. By default, each qubit in the register is initialized to $|0\rangle$. To make the GHZ state, we apply the following gates:
- A Hadamard gate $H$ on qubit 0, which puts it into the superposition state $\left(|0\rangle+|1\rangle\right)/\sqrt{2}$.
- A Controlled-NOT operation ($C_{X}$) between qubit 0 and qubit 1.
- A Controlled-NOT operation between qubit 0 and qubit 2.

On an ideal quantum computer, the state produced by running this circuit would be the GHZ state above.

Operations can be added to the circuit one by one, as shown below.

```python
# Add a H gate on qubit 0, putting this qubit in superposition.
circ.h(0)
# Add a CX (CNOT) gate on control qubit 0 and target qubit 1, putting
# the qubits in a Bell state.
circ.cx(0, 1)
# Add a CX (CNOT) gate on control qubit 0 and target qubit 2, putting
# the qubits in a GHZ state.
circ.cx(0, 2)
```
## Visualize the circuit
You can visualize your circuit using Qiskit `QuantumCircuit.draw()`, which plots the circuit in the form found in many textbooks.

```python
circ.draw('mpl')
```
