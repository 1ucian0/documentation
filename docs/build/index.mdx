# Build circuits with Qiskit

In the build phase, you create quantum programs that represent the problem you are solving. The foundation of quantum programs are quantum circuits, which are made up of gates (or operations) that are used to manipulate qubits in the quantum computer. You can also use _primitives_, which provide methods that make it easier to build modular algorithms and other higher-order programs, as well as providing the interface to run those circuits on a backend and get outputs in a specific format.  Depending on your needs, you can use Qiskit or OpenQASM to create your circuits, followed by Qiskit Runtime to initialize your chosen primitive for an IBM Quantum backend. In summary, the build phase consists of these processes:

1. Defining quantum circuits
2. Initializing primitives
