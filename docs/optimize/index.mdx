# Optimize Qiskit programs

In the optimization phase, you fine-tune your build options to get the most out of the programs you have written. You can optimize your programs in any or all of the following ways:

- [Set algorithm tuning options](algorithm-tuning-options).
- [Configure error suppression](error-suppression).
- [Configure error mitigation](error-mitigation).
